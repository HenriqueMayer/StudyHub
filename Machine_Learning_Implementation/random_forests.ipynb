    "### Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests are an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results to improve prediction accuracy and control over-fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tree Construction:**\n",
    "   - **Create as many trees as you want:** Each tree is built using a different subset of data, which is randomly sampled.\n",
    "   - **Random Subsets:** For each tree, a random subset of features is used to create splits, introducing diversity in the ensemble.\n",
    "   - **Majority Vote Principle:** The final prediction is based on combining the outcomes of all trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prediction:**\n",
    "   - **Get the predictions from each tree.**\n",
    "   - **If**\n",
    "     - **Classification:** The final class label is determined by a majority vote (the class that gets the most votes from the individual trees is selected).\n",
    "     - **Regression:** The final output is the average of all the predictions from the trees."
